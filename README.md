# Claude Code Skills Collection

A collection of Claude Code skills for enhanced software development workflows, focusing on structured requirements documentation and task management.

## Skills

### rpg-prd

RPG-style PRD (Product Requirements Document) generator with progressive disclosure capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **RPG Methodology**: Dual-semantics approach separating WHAT (functional capabilities) from HOW (structural implementation)
- **Dependency Graphs**: Explicit module dependencies with visual Mermaid diagrams
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Automatic partitioning of large PRDs for context efficiency
- **Phased Roadmaps**: Implementation tasks organized by dependency layers with clear entry/exit criteria
- **Research Integration**: Organize and analyze materials before PRD generation

**Quick Start:**
```
/rpg-prd research <files-or-urls>
/rpg-prd generate <project-name>
/rpg-prd load <project>:phase-1
```

### prd-taskmaster

Task management system optimized for software projects with built-in RPG PRD integration.

**Key Features:**
- **PRD Parsing**: Automatically convert PRD phases into actionable tasks
- **Dependency Tracking**: Validates task dependencies before execution
- **Smart Task Selection**: Prioritizes tasks based on dependencies and priority levels
- **Task Analysis**: AI-powered complexity assessment and subtask generation
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Support for nested subtasks with dotted ID notation (1.1, 1.2, etc.)

**Quick Start:**
```
/prd-taskmaster init [prd-file]
/prd-taskmaster add "implement feature"
/prd-taskmaster next
/prd-taskmaster complete 1
```

## Installation

These skills are designed for use with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code).

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI installed
- Git installed

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository to your Claude Code plugins directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ff4415/skills.git ~/.claude-plugins/skills
```

2. The skills will be automatically available in Claude Code sessions.

### Verifying Installation

In a Claude Code session, you can verify the skills are loaded by checking for:
- `/rpg-prd` command availability
- `/prd-taskmaster` command availability

## Usage Examples

### Creating a PRD and Managing Tasks

Complete workflow from requirements to task execution:

```bash
# 1. Research phase - gather and organize materials
/rpg-prd research design-doc.md api-spec.yaml

# 2. Generate PRD using RPG methodology
/rpg-prd generate my-feature

# 3. Initialize task tracking from the PRD
/prd-taskmaster init .prd/my-feature/overview.md

# 4. Get next available task
/prd-taskmaster next

# 5. Complete tasks as you work
/prd-taskmaster complete 1
```

### Working with Large Projects

For large PRDs that auto-partition:

```bash
# Generate large PRD (auto-partitions at 2000+ lines)
/rpg-prd generate complex-system

# Load specific phase for implementation
/rpg-prd load complex-system:phase-1

# Initialize tasks from specific phase
/prd-taskmaster init .prd/complex-system/phase-1-core.md
```

### Task Management Workflow

```bash
# Add a new task
/prd-taskmaster add "implement user authentication"

# Analyze task complexity
/prd-taskmaster analyze 1

# Expand into subtasks if complex
/prd-taskmaster expand 1

# List all tasks with filtering
/prd-taskmaster list --status pending

# Update task with notes
/prd-taskmaster update 1 "blocked on API design review"
```

## File Structure

### Generated by rpg-prd

Small PRDs (< 2000 lines):
```
.prd/<project-name>/
├── manifest.md        # Quick context and navigation
└── overview.md        # Complete PRD
```

Large PRDs (≥ 2000 lines):
```
.prd/<project-name>/
├── manifest.md           # Summary and navigation
├── dependency-graph.md   # Full dependency visualization
├── overview.md           # Problem, users, capabilities
├── phase-0-foundation.md # Foundation tasks
├── phase-1-xxx.md        # Phase 1 tasks
└── phase-N-xxx.md        # Additional phases
```

## Why These Skills?

### Problem: Context Inefficiency in Large Projects

Traditional PRDs and task lists can become unwieldy, consuming too much context when working on specific features. These skills solve this through:

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Load only what you need when you need it
2. **Dependency Clarity**: Always know what must be done first
3. **Phased Implementation**: Break large projects into manageable chunks
4. **Task Hierarchy**: Navigate from high-level goals to specific implementation details

### The RPG Methodology

RPG (Requirements, Planning, Graph) provides:

- **Dual-Semantics**: Clear separation of functional requirements (WHAT) from structural design (HOW)
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Every module states its dependencies upfront
- **Topological Order**: Build foundation layers before dependent layers
- **Progressive Refinement**: Broad capabilities → specific features → concrete tasks
